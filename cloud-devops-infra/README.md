### Cloud, DevOps, Infra

#### Compute & Storage
  
  - [Cray Computers](https://www.cray.com/ai)
  - [GraphCore's IPU](README.md#ipu)

#### Cloud services

  - [vast.ai](about-vast.ai.md) - GPU Sharing Economy. One simple interface to find the best cloud GPU rentals. Reduce cloud compute costs by 3X to 5X
  - [paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) - The first cloud built for the future. Powering next-generation applications and cloud ML/AI pipelines. Paperspace is built to scale with your team - pay as you go option for individuals.
  - [valohai](https://www.valohai.com/) | [docs](https://docs.valohai.com/) - Valohai is a machine learning platform. It runs your experiments in the cloud, tracks your experiment history and streamlines data science workflows. DEEP LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLATFORM. Machine Orchestration, Version Control and Pipeline Management for Deep Learning.
  
#### Tools
  - [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. [Slides](https://slides.com/johanneskoester/snakemake-talk-40min#) | [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/snakemake/)
  - [plz](http://github.com/prodo-ai/plz) - Plz (pronounced "please") runs your jobs storing code, input, outputs and results so that they can be queried programmatically.

#### CPU
  - Probing the CPU (Linux/MacOS)
      + [libcpuid](http://libcpuid.sourceforge.net/index.html)
      + Zero overhead performance capturing: use `/proc/interrupts` and `/proc/softirqs`
      + Non-zero overhead, less accurate: use the PMU (capture on- and off-core events)
  - Probing the CPU (Windows)
      + [perfview](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview) - general profiling on Windows
      + [perfview for .net](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/perfview-net) - excellent overview by Sasha Goldshtein
 
 _Thanks to the great minds on the [mechanical sympathy](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mechanical-sympathy) mailing list for their responses to my queries on CPU probing._

#### GPU
  - [Know your GPU](https://gist.github.com/neomatrix369/256913dcf77cdbb5855dd2d7f5d81b84)

#### TPU
