## Weights & Biases

- https://www.wandb.com/
- W&B is a key piece of our fast-paced, cutting-edge, large-scale research workflow: great flexibility, performance, and user experience.
- Experiment tracking for deep learning
- Instrument training scripts
- Stages covered: only from Model training to deploy (run multiple experiments, track and look at the data visualisations - only helps track, and use the info to plot graphs and make your decisions)
- Pros:
  - Supports model execution and tracking of the execution
  - Gathers good stats / metrics to make sound decisions after or during execution of experiments
  - Has support for comparisons of experiments (and models) and performances
  - Tracks the best model producing during experiments execution
  - Supports multiple python frameworks (keras, tensorflow, pytorch)
  - Getting started with tool is really easy and great way to integrate hooks into our experiment code
  - Very good UX, docs and site layout, user-friendly
- Cons:
  - Does not support or have tooling for stages before experiment execution (i.e. data cleaning, visualisation, data validation, feature extraction)
  - Not sure if they provide infrastructure on which we can run our experiments
